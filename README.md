# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-means-Clustering
This project involves segmenting customers using k-means clustering in Jupyter Notebook. Customer segmentation is a powerful technique used in marketing and business analytics to divide customers into distinct groups based on their behaviors, preferences, or demographics. Through this project, we aim to explore and understand how k-means clustering can be used for customer segmentation.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains customer information, such as age, gender, income, and spending habits. The dataset should be preprocessed and cleaned before using it for clustering. It is important to have numerical features or encode categorical variables into numerical form for k-means clustering.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/fartaletejal-cloud/Customer-Segmentation-using-K-means-Clustering.git
Change into the project directory:
cd Customer-Segmentation-KMeansClustering
Install the required dependencies:

Run Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Open the Customer Segmentation.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, apply k-means clustering, and analyze the customer segments.

Project Overview
The notebook provides an overview of the steps involved in customer segmentation using k-means clustering. The steps include:

Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if any), and scaling numerical features.
K-means Clustering: Applying the k-means clustering algorithm on the preprocessed dataset to identify customer segments.
Cluster Analysis: Analyzing the resulting customer segments based on their characteristics and behaviors.
Visualization: Visualizing the customer segments using plots or other visual techniques.
The notebook includes explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to aid in understanding the customer segmentation process using k-means clustering.

Results and Insights
The project aims to segment customers based on their characteristics and behaviors using k-means clustering. The results and insights gained from this project include:

Identifying distinct customer segments based on similarities or patterns in the data.
Understanding the characteristics, preferences, or behaviors that define each customer segment.
Tailoring marketing strategies, product offerings, or customer experiences to target specific customer segments effectively.
The insights gained from this project can help businesses optimize their marketing efforts, personalize customer experiences, and improve customer satisfaction.
